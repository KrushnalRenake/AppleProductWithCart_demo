==========LLM call for step "extractAppSkeleton":==========
You help the user building a Fiori Elements application described in the user input.

A Fiori Elements application typically starts with a ListReport page showing the data of the base entity of the application in a table.
Details of a specific table row are shown in the ObjectPage. This first ObjectPage is therefore based on the base entity of the application.
An ObjectPage can contain one or more table sections based on to-many associations of its entity type.
The details of a table section row can be shown in an another ObjectPage based on the associations target entity.

Your task is to find the entities (with their to-many associations) as well as the ObjectPages (with the to-many associations they use in table sections) described in the user input below.

You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}
would match an object with one required property, "foo". The "type" property specifies "foo" must be an "array", and the "description" property semantically describes it as "a list of test words". The items within "foo" must be strings.
Thus, the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of this example "JSON Schema". The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

Your output will be parsed and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!

Here is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing markdown codeblock:
```json

    "entities": {
      "type": "array",

==========LLM call for step "extractEntitiesProperties":==========
You help the user refining the DataModel for a Fiori Elements application described in the user input.

The DataModel consists of the following entities and associations:
- entity "AppleProducts" (with to-many associations to "ShoppingCarts")
- entity "ShoppingCarts" (with to-one association to "AppleProducts")

Your task is to find the properties for each entity.

You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}
would match an object with one required property, "foo". The "type" property specifies "foo" must be an "array", and the "description" property semantically describes it as "a list of test words". The items within "foo" must be strings.
Thus, the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of this example "JSON Schema". The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

Your output will be parsed and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!

Here is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing markdown codeblock:

User attached information: I want to create an SAP Fiori application that satisfies the requirements from the following user story:

Description

As a customer, I want to browse available Apple products and add them to my shopping cart, so that I can easily purchase my desired items.

Customer Description

Apple Product: An Apple product is a device or accessory manufactured by Apple Inc., which can include items such as iPhones, iPads, MacBooks, Apple Watches, and accessories like AirPods.
Common attributes of an Apple product might include:

Product ID: A unique identifier for the product.
Name: The name of the product (e.g., iPhone 14, MacBook Air).
Price: The cost of the product.
Description: A brief overview of the product features and specifications.

Product List: A list of products added to the cart.
Total Price: The total cost of all items in the cart.
Quantity: The number of each product added to the cart.
Acceptance Criteria

Scenario 1: List All Apple Products
Given I am logged into the Apple Cart application, when I launch the SAP Fiori application to view available products, then I should be able to see a list of all available Apple products without pressing the GO button.

The list of available products should include: Product ID, Name, Price, and Availability.

Next to this list, I would like to see a summary of my shopping cart, including the total number of items and total price.

Scenario 2: Add Product to Cart
Given I am logged into the Apple Cart application, when I select a specific product from the list of available Apple products, then I should be able to add that product to my shopping cart.

The shopping cart should update to reflect the new product, showing the updated total price and quantity.

Scenario 3: View Shopping Cart
Given I am logged into the Apple Cart application, when I navigate to my shopping cart, then I should be able to view all products added to the cart.

The shopping cart details will include:

Field Name	Tab in App	Section or Field Group
Cart ID	Cart Overview	Cart Details
Product Name	Cart Overview	Product List
Quantity	Cart Overview	Product List
Price	Cart Overview	Product List

==========LLM call for step "extractListReport":==========
A Fiori Elements Application has the following pages:
 - ListReport page for "AppleProducts"
 - ObjectPage for "AppleProducts"
 - ObjectPage for "ShoppingCarts"

Available entities with their associations and elements are:
Entity "AppleProducts"
   Properties:
       productID: A unique identifier for the product.
       name: The name of the product (e.g., iPhone 14, MacBook Air).
       price: The cost of the product.
       description: A brief overview of the product features and specifications.
       availability: Information on whether the product is in stock or out of stock.
   Associations:
       ShoppingCarts: association to many entities ShoppingCarts
Entity "ShoppingCarts"
   Properties:
       cartID: A unique identifier for the shopping cart.
       productList: A list of products added to the cart.
       totalPrice: The total cost of all items in the cart.
       quantity: The number of each product added to the cart.
   Associations:
       appleProducts: association to single entity AppleProducts

The user input below describes the details of the ListReport page (i.e. its filters, tables or views with their columns).

Your task is to help the user defining the ListReport page.

You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}
would match an object with one required property, "foo". The "type" property specifies "foo" must be an "array", and the "description" property semantically describes it as "a list of test words". The items within "foo" must be strings.
Thus, the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of this example "JSON Schema". The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

Your output will be parsed and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!

Here is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing markdown codeblock:
```json

 - ObjectPage for "AppleProducts"
 - ObjectPage for "ShoppingCarts"

Your task is to find the details of the ObjectPage for "AppleProducts".
The base entity of the ObjectPage is AppleProducts.
This ObjectPage can contain tabs and/or sections which in turn contain tables and fields.
It must contain table sections containing data for associated entity "ShoppingCarts" (via association ShoppingCarts);

The underlying data model allows the following propertyPaths:
 - productID: Product ID (of Apple Product)
 - name: Name (of Apple Product)
 - price: Price (of Apple Product)
 - description: Description (of Apple Product)
 - availability: Availability (of Apple Product)
 - ShoppingCarts/cartID: Cart ID (of many associated Shopping Cart)
 - ShoppingCarts/productList: Product List (of many associated Shopping Cart)
 - ShoppingCarts/totalPrice: Total Price (of many associated Shopping Cart)
 - ShoppingCarts/quantity: Quantity (of many associated Shopping Cart)

==========LLM call for step "extractColors":==========
You help the user creating a Fiori Elements application based on user input describing such an application.
Your task is to determine whether the entity properties can be considered good and bad in most contexts or are usually neutral. When in doubt, set to neutral.

These are the entity properties and their values:
Entity: AppleProducts, Property: name, Values: iPhone 14, MacBook Air
Entity: AppleProducts, Property: availability, Values: in stock, out of stock

If the properties can be considered good and bad, the allowed values for their criticality and the associated colors are:
   negative: red
   critical: yellow or orange
   positive: green
   neutral:  grey

You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}
would match an object with one required property, "foo". The "type" property specifies "foo" must be an "array", and the "description" property semantically describes it as "a list of test words". The items within "foo" must be strings.
Thus, the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of this example "JSON Schema". The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

Your output will be parsed and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!

Here is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing markdown codeblock:
```json

<UserInput>
User prompt: Create an application based on given text file
User attached information: I want to create an SAP Fiori application that satisfies the requirements from the following user story:

Description

As a customer, I want to browse available Apple products and add them to my shopping cart, so that I can easily purchase my desired items.

Customer Description

Apple Product: An Apple product is a device or accessory manufactured by Apple Inc., which can include items such as iPhones, iPads, MacBooks, Apple Watches, and accessories like AirPods. Common attributes of an Apple product might include:

Product ID: A unique identifier for the product.
Name: The name of the product (e.g., iPhone 14, MacBook Air).
Price: The cost of the product.
Description: A brief overview of the product features and specifications.
Availability: Information on whether the product is in stock or out of stock.
Shopping Cart: A shopping cart is a virtual cart that allows customers to collect products they wish to purchase. A typical shopping cart has the following attributes:

Cart ID: A unique identifier for the shopping cart.
Product List: A list of products added to the cart.
Total Price: The total cost of all items in the cart.
Quantity: The number of each product added to the cart.
Acceptance Criteria

Scenario 1: List All Apple Products
Given I am logged into the Apple Cart application, when I launch the SAP Fiori application to view available products, then I should be able to see a list of all available Apple products without pressing the GO button.

The list of available products should include: Product ID, Name, Price, and Availability.

Next to this list, I would like to see a summary of my shopping cart, including the total number of items and total price.

Scenario 2: Add Product to Cart
Given I am logged into the Apple Cart application, when I select a specific product from the list of available Apple products, then I should be able to add that product to my shopping cart.

The shopping cart should update to reflect the new product, showing the updated total price and quantity.

Scenario 3: View Shopping Cart
Given I am logged into the Apple Cart application, when I navigate to my shopping cart, then I should be able to view all products added to the cart.

The shopping cart details will include:

Field Name	Tab in App	Section or Field Group
Cart ID	Cart Overview	Cart Details
Product Name	Cart Overview	Product List
Quantity	Cart Overview	Product List
Price	Cart Overview	Product List
Total Price	Cart Overview	Summary

==========LLM call for data generation:==========

For the following list of entities, create data for the empty CSV files.
Entity "AppleProducts" - Properties:
    productID: String(50), A unique identifier for the product.
    name: String(100), The name of the product (e.g., iPhone 14, MacBook Air).
    price: Decimal, The cost of the product.
    description: String(255), A brief overview of the product features and specifications.
    availability: String(50), Information on whether the product is in stock or out of stock.

Entity "ShoppingCarts" - Properties:
    cartID: String(50), A unique identifier for the shopping cart.
    productList: String(255), A list of products added to the cart.
    totalPrice: Decimal, The total cost of all items in the cart.
    quantity: Integer, The number of each product added to the cart.
    appleProducts_productID: String(50), productID of associated AppleProducts

Empty CSV files in json format (only generate content for these files!):
{"AppleProducts.csv":"productID;name;price;description;availability","ShoppingCarts.csv":"cartID;productList;totalPrice;quantity;appleProducts_productID"}

Rules:
    - Take over the given header line, do not invent new columns!
    - For a given file, add rows, add '\n' characters before each row but don't break the JSON string
    - Do not generate rows with same key values, they must be unique!
    - Make sure that associations match, i.e. a field containing "Name of the associated Customer" must contain an existing Name of entity Customer
    - Always use ";" as a delimiter in CSV files
    - The result must be proper JSON format so it can be parsed, don't break JSON strings within, don't add quotes around values.
    - Create about 5 rows for the first csv, 7 for the second and so on
    - All values must be realistic with meaningful content, e.g. 'Laptop Screen' and not just placeholder values with incremented numbers like 'Product 1', 'Product 2' etc.
    
Use format for values:
  String(50): string no longer than 50 characters
  Decimal(3,2): 1.23
  Integer, Double: only numbers, no special symbols
    
For the following fields, use only the supplied allowed values (as they are, don't insert spaces or change case):
- availability (of AppleProducts): instock, outofstock

Example output (Do NOT include in output!):
```json
